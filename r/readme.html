<h3 id="checking-ranks-and-updating-roles">Checking Ranks and Updating Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>To verify and update your in-game rank, send a direct message to @ChessBot1 with the following command: !r</li>
<li>Chessbot will DM you your current rank and role in a direct message. Make sure you have DMs enabled in Discord and are not set to invisible.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="finding-joining-and-hosting-games">Finding, Joining, and Hosting Games</h2>
<p>The first step to being able to join our matchmaking games is login in with your steam via the <a href="https://qihl.gg/">https://qihl.gg</a> website. Once you are logged in, you can join any lobbies that you are eligible for after clicking on <strong>Matchmaking</strong>.</p>
<p>Games are usually arranged through the website. If you find irregularities, feel free to drop by #help-desk and or <code>#qihlfeedback</code>.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-players">Reporting Players</h2>
<p>Sometimes, players don’t follow the rules and you may feel like something needs to be done about it. To learn how to report someone properly, go to <code>#report-readme</code> before anything else.</p>
<p>If you are in danger of demotion from your current rank (e.g. You are Bishop-1, and playing in a bishop-1 and over lobby but just place bottom4 in your last game) you should wait for your game to complete and your rank to update before you join another game. If your rank updates before you join your next game, but after you join the <a href="http://qihl.gg">qihl.gg</a> lobby, and you are below the minimum rank while in game (e.g. you lost your previous game and are now Knight-9) you must forfeit the game (by typing -refresh in game, NOT in Discord) or be banned from this server.</p>
<p>Players that experience this in your games, please consider not caring about a one-rank difference. It doesn’t have a serious impact, and is often an honest mistake. Making a big deal of these instances is seldom beneficial for anyone. This is not an invitation to do this, however, and we do not condone this behavior. We will be handing out bans for this to repeat offenders, so please be careful.</p>
<p>If a player refuses to forfeit (-refresh in game, NOT in Discord): Post a screenshot of the game, their Steam Profile URL, and the lobby password to #player-reports. If you don’t provide all three of these things, the report won’t be considered. If you need to report a player for some other reason, explain the reason in <code>#player-reports</code> and make sure you have proper proof.</p>
<h2 id="about-qihl-website">About qihl website</h2>
<p>Qihl’s primary goal is to be the easiest, fastest, and most convenient place to find fair Auto Chess lobbies with other players near your rank. Up until recently our Discord server and Discord bots have been the best way for us to accomplish this goal, but due to incredible growth and popularity of Auto Chess, our community has ballooned up to a size where Discord is no longer capable of handling its demands. The Discord bots we use for verifying player’s ranks and for joining lobbies have been shutting down more and more frequently as they continually become overloaded with requests, which has forced us to remove bot access from players of more and more skill levels over time.</p>
<p>With the continuing growth of the qihl community and no way for us to increase the load capacity of our Discord bots, these problems will only continue to get worse over time. Any and all long-term solutions to improving our matchmaking service must begin by migrating to a new platform with our own servers, and a web-based matchmaker seemed like the most natural solution.</p>
<p>Team Liquid have developed and will maintain the website and are welcoming all positive and negative feedback on our Discord server, in the<code>#qihlfeedback</code> channel.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing our passion for this game, and good luck, have fun!</p>
